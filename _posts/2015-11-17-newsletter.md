OpenTechSchool is a global initiative, spread throughout countries, continents,
and timezones.  With our [blueprints][] and [Discourse][] platform we have
always been trying to connect our distributed membership.  Up until now, there
has been no good way to just stay informed with all that's new in
OpenTechSchool.

We are introducing our monthly newsletter as a means to keep up with what your
fellow friends in other chapters are doing.

It is scheduled for the 20th each month, as to include the contents of the
latest [Community Call][] (which takes places around the 15th each month.)  If
you have exciting content to share with the community at large, please approach
us at [team.newsletter@][].
