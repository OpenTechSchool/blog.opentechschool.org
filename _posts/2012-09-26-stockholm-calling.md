teaser: "Not even two weeks ago, our core team member Beatrice Martini went to Stockholm. One of her missions there: find out whether people are interested in starting some local OpenTechSchool Group there. And take our learnings there as a blueprint on how to make the movement grow in other cities around the globe. And we were not mistaken, there seems to be a huge demand in the local tech and startup community. We already secured a venue and have first ideas for when to do workshops. What we need now, are more people from the local community joining and helping organise, coach and get the word out. "

Not even two weeks ago, our core team member Beatrice Martini went to Stockholm. One of her missions there: find out whether people are interested in starting some local OpenTechSchool Group there. And take our learnings there as a blueprint on how to make the movement grow in other cities around the globe. And we were not mistaken, there seems to be a huge demand in the local tech and startup community. We already secured a venue and have first ideas for when to do workshops. What we need now, are more people from the local community joining and helping organise, coach and get the word out.

So if you are interested in what is going on with OpenTechSchool Stockholm, have ideas you want to share, want to help organise or coach please sign up to our public mailinglist below. There is good stuff going to come your way and we need all the help we can get to make most of it.
