Our regular [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) Hack and Learn meetup has now [officially joined](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/227320730/) the OpenTechSchool umbrella. We meet biweekly and learn the new programming language created by Mozilla. The Rust Hack and Learn is coached by Florian Gilcher, member of the global Rust community team, Johann Hofman, founder of the group and Florian Hartwig.

We make this move because we wanted to join an organisation that supports us in our goals and provides a helpful framework. OpenTechSchool runs many events with a similar concept and promotes them, which allows us to be more effective in our outreach by doing it together with other language communities that share our goals and values. This includes our community diversity goals.

Finally, many of us come from other language communities and see a lot of value in collaborating instead of telling juvenile jokes about each other.

The [Rust Berlin](http://www.meetup.com/Rust-Berlin/) meetup will still continue to exist and will host the irregular meetups with talks and other perojects.
