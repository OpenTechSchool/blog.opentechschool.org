What a beautiful summer this is. I think we all deserve some blue sky after
last weeks ehhh-kinda weather. So I'll not keep you from spending your time
outside too long and get right to the point.

As you might have heard our friends from the [Dortmund chapter][] are hosting
**the very first [OTSConf][]** there this summer.


On August 15th they will host talks ranging from an *introduction to
Evolutionary Algorithms*, over *queuing protocols* and *functional programming*
to *diversity and women in Open Source.* And as if that wasn't enough, the next
days follows – in good old OTS tradition – [a day of workshops][] and hands-on
learning. **It's gonna be fab.**

But this wouldn't be OpenTechSchool, if there wasn't an *extra effort taken to
ensure diversity and inclusion* beyond what is usual. The conference comes with
a clear code of conduct (which also sponsors have to sign), they are hosted in
completely accessible venue with a guidance system for visually impaired, have
vegetarian and vegan meal options, offer **student tickets, [community and
diversity tickets][] and a discount for members of the OTS Foundation.** On
top, if you need someone to look after your kid(s) during the conference,
**there will be child care** (ping them).

If you have any other questions, you can reach the organising team of the
conference directly [on slack][].
