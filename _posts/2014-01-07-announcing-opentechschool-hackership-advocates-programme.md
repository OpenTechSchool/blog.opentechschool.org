As you [already know](http://localhost:4000/2013/12/a-look-back-on-2013.html), the OpenTechSchool Berlin [is currently raising funds](www.indiegogo.com/projects/an-apprenticeship-for-hackers-a-hackership/) to create the first OpenTechSchool Learning Space and run – aside from its awesome free workshops at evenings and weekends – the [Hackership full-time code learning programme and master class for advanced programmer](http://www.hackership.org) there. And now, you can help raising these funds yourself as we are announcing the [Hackership Advocates Programme](http://www.opentechschool.org/hackership):

You are excited about the idea of a OpenTechSchool Hackership learning space? You want to help raise the visibility and funds for it? **Become an official [Hackership Advocate now](http://discourse.opentechschool.org/t/application-for-hackership-advocats-programme/407)**.

## Becoming an advocate
The OpenTechSchool community is very **diverse** – there are **pirates, samurais, unicorns, terminators and robots, bears and kittens** – and we'd like to represent that. **Please pick one of the previously mentioned themes and apply it to a picture of you** – whether you photoshop it, [use an](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-me-pirate/id586117979?mt=8) [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appspot.swisscodemonkeys.pirate&hl=en) or dress ups for real is up to you. Then post this picture together with the name you want to have displayed and your indiegogo account on the following thread. We are looking forward to your submission.

[Post it here](http://discourse.opentechschool.org/t/application-for-hackership-advocats-programme/407).


After that, there is only one last thing left to become an official advocate: as soon as you are shown on the the [Hackership Advocates website](http://www.opentechschool.org/hackership), officially announce your participation – either through a tweet or a Facebook or Google+ post. Congratulations, you just became a Hackership Advocate!

## Benefits of being an advocate

Aside the obvious – being awesome and featured with a cool picture on the website – being an advocate comes with some more benefits. Through the Indiegogo account you provided in the post, we'll track donations made through referrals by you and **award you with prizes**: For just five donations (independent of the amount) referred by you, you'll receive one of the **limited edition Hackership-Advocate-Shirt** (only available through this programme). And once ten or more donations happened thanks to your referral, **you'll receive a spot on our Danke-Schön-Wall** as mentioned on the perks (for usually 2.048Eur at least). 

And that's not all: Who ever refers to the highest single donation will officially be named [Chief Mate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_mate) of Hackership including a prime-spot in bigger letters with their new title on our wall. And the one referring the highest total donations will be announced [Chief Engineer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_engineer) of Hackership, including the same features. 



*Note*: we can only account donations made through your referral of you. So please make sure to **[use your personalized Indiegogo-link](http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20582313-how-to-share-your-campaign#overview)** when you post about it. If that didn't happen (because maybe you convinced them at an event), make the donor posts a (hidden) comment on the campaign telling us he got referred by you and we'll add this to your referrals. End-time of this competition is the end of the [Indiegogo-campaign](www.indiegogo.com/projects/an-apprenticeship-for-hackers-a-hackership/). T-Shirts will be sent out accordingly after.
