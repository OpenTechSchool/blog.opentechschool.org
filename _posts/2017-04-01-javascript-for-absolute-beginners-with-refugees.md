Last Saturday (25 March) we did a [JavaScript for Absolute Beginners workshop in Berlin](
https://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-berlin/events/238213272/) again.

This one was particularly special as we successfully reached out to new people - in this case refugees. We got invited by [Neue Nachbarschaft Moabit](http://neuenachbarschaft.de), a community initiative for bringing together newcomers and locals, to do the workshop at their wonderful café. We were happy to have a diverse group of learners, coaches and organizers, half of them members of the Neue Nachbarschaft community.

A big Thank You goes out to the many helping hands that

 - organized everything regarding the venue
 - prepared the OpenTechSchool laptops so we could give them out to learners that didn't bring one
 - installed extra [Freifunk](https://berlin.freifunk.net) routers to make the wifi stable enough for the 40 people we had in the room
 - gave presentations about OTS and JavaScript

and of course to the coaches!

Some of the learners volunteered to participate in establishing a new Open Co-Learning at Neue Nachbarschaft.

We are looking forward to run more successful events with Neue Nachbarschaft.
