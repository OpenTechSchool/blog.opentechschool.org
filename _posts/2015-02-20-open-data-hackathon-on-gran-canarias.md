OpenTechSchool, through [the Hackership](http://www.hackership.org) Team, once again pushes for a more open and accessible society for all, advanced through programming and hacking: together with the [Google Developer Group Gran Canaria](https://twitter.com/GDGGranCanaria), [Incube](http://incubegc.com/), the Department of Engineering of the Univesity of Las Palmas and in collaboration with the local Goverment, we are organising an OpenData Hackathon on **February 28th, 2015**.

After a learner at Hackership Batch-2 found out there is plenty of interesting [OpenData available for Las Palmas and Gran Canaria](http://datosabiertos.laspalmasgc.es/) but there are not so many apps build on top, the organisers reached out to the local tech community to learn more about this data and what could be done with it. This idea fell on fruitful ground and quickly Hackership and GDG were meeting with representatives from the local government, who were happy learn there is something done with the data and encouraged the organisation of a Hackathon.

With so much wind in the sails, it was no question, we had to organise a hackathon. So OpenTechSchool, Hackership and GDG are happy to announce, that Saturday, the 28th, we will get together to hack on the OpenData of the Canary Islands and around for 24hours. If you are interested in joining, please let us know as quickly as possible [through this form](https://adobeformscentral.com/?f=SxDCixVhJJxMBNK3FkT46w).
