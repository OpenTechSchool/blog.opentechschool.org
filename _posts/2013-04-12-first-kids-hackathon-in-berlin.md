[HacKIDemia](http://www.hackidemia.com), [OpenTechSchool](http://www.opentechschool.org/) and [Toywheel](http://toywheel.com/) are bringing the hackathon format of working together on technology in interactive workshops to the world of Kids in Berlin with their first Kids Hackathon on Sunday, April 28th 2013.

Do you have a child (6 to 15 years old) and you want them to learn the latest technologies hands on and by experimenting in interactive workshops? Bring them to our Kids Hackathon where they learn to use microcontrollers, crafts and programming to express themselves and their ideas in the areas of interactive storytelling, space, music, healthcare and body functions, environment and ocean.
