![It has been a colorful year](/assets/content/2013-12-30-year-in-review.jpg)

Twenty thirteen. The first full year after it started in April 2012. And what a year it was. It was a truly great year for OpenTechSchool. Let's take a short look back on what happened this year and take a small peak into the future and what is yet to come – which is at least as exciting.

We started the year right away with some formalities. On January fifth a [few of us came togetherr](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/05/opentechschool-is-now-a-foundation.html) to officially initiate the OpenTechSchool Foundation – the legal and liable entity. While on the other side of the world our dear friend Steven Farlie established the third chapter of OpenTechSchool. After Berlin and Stockholm, Melbourne joined as the third local team – and the first one outside of Europe. But that shouldn't be the last chapter to join that year.

### More chapters

Over the year, the movement grew. Other chapters joined initiated by Berlin team members but also by community members outside. As the time of this writing, almost twelve months later, we have teams active in [Berlin](http://www.opentechschool.org/berlin/), [Brussels](http://www.opentechschool.org/brussels/), [Dortmund](http://www.opentechschool.org/dortmund/), [Hamburg](http://www.opentechschool.org/hamburg/), [Melbourne](http://www.opentechschool.org/melbourne/), [Nairobi](http://www.opentechschool.org/nairobi/), [Ramallah](http://www.opentechschool.org/ramallah/), [Stockholm](http://www.opentechschool.org/stockholm/), [Tel-Aviv](http://www.meetup.com/opentechschool-tel-aviv/) and [Zurich](http://www.opentechschool.org/zurich/). And I personally know of at least two more endeavors, in London and RheinMain, which are going to join very soon. A total of twelve chapters on four continents – in year. Not too shabby.

With the number of new chapters, also the total reach grew. We are - as of now - counting a total of 3.962 Learners in our various meetup-groups, in which Berlin takes the biggest part with 1.883 (over three times as many compared to 594 on the 1st of January). And it also grew on the other side of the spectrum, the OpenTechSchool's coaches lists now account 217 unique email addresses and through the various team email lists, over 90 people are contributing in organizing events.

### More workshops

![Kids Hackathon](http://blog.opentechschool.org/assets/content/2013-04-12-kids-hackathon-poster.png)

Events like the [Kids Hackathon](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/04/first-kids-hackathon-in-berlin.html), which OpenTechSchool co-organised with Hakidemia this year in Berlin, the [IT-Student Labs](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/01/announcing-student-labs-in-berlin.html) in [Zurich](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/09/zurich-kids-education.html) and Berlin, the [App Summer Camp](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/07/app-summer-camp-in-hamburg-it-was-awesome.html) for teenage Girls the Hamburg Team pulled off or the [regular Learners Meetups](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/06/how-the-learners-meetup-is-doing-in-berlin.html). And of course new learning material has been added to the portfolio. As our newly created overview page shows, we've created another five workshop materials totally from scratch this year (we had three by then). 

Not only based on those but on all kind of learning material that is out there in the widst of the internets, the global OpenTechSchool **has hosted 192 events out of which 137 where hands-on and workshop focused** this year alone, empowering a total of 3.700 participants to learn more about coding and technology (2.087 at the hands-on events respectively). But that isn't all. Aside from adding new materials, trying more formats for the younger (as mentioned earlier), OpenTechSchool Berlin also explored, how learning can continue after the first weekend workshop.

### More learning

<div style="text-align:center;position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0px; padding-bottom: 56.5%; margin: 25px auto;"><iframe src="//player.vimeo.com/video/82717221" style="position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; left: 0px; top: 0px;" width="500" height="281" webkitallowfullscreen="1" mozallowfullscreen="1" allowfullscreen="1">&nbsp;</iframe>
</div>

Out of which we've developed two new formats: the first one are the continuous learning groups, where people meet regularly up to once a week on a weeknight evening after hours to work on their own projects at nice music and beers. Of course, as always, the coaches are only an arm-length away and help with questions and problems at any time. We've successfully implemented this with Javascript and Python and we know the RailsGirls in Berlin are doing a similar thing. These groups shall allow each and everyone to continue to learn with OTS support without having to quit their job or taking on expensive courses to reach the level of a junior developer.

The other is [Hackership](http://www.hackership.org) full-time code learning programme and master class for experienced developers, who want to acquire new skills or get better at what they already do. The first experimental Batch ended about two weeks ago and the results are very promising. It is possible to transfer our model of an inclusive, welcoming and friendly learning environment to learning advanced topics, too. And it the most productive and efficient way to learn we've seen so far. 

### Outlook

Berlin is the first chapter to reach its capacity though. We have more workshops and formats in the pipeline and more people on the lists than we have space to run these events. Especially growing on continuous learning groups and running the full-time programme require space and equipment beyond what our sponsors are able to host by themselves. But encouraged from this years successes, we don't want to slow down or even stop to grow this. If anything we want to host more events. That's why we are creating the first OpenTechSchool Learning Space in Berlin in 2014, a location dedicated to learning tech – open, friendly and welcoming. During the day it will host Hackership, in the evenings, on Fridays and during the weekend more and cooler OpenTechSchool events for a wider audience and more people. In order to make this a reality, [we are currently raising funds through this Indiegogo campaign](http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/an-apprenticeship-for-hackers-a-hackership). Please spread the word.

Another thing that might be coming 2014 is a stronger focus on getting all global teams closer together and community closer with each other. We already had quite some successes with the [HTML-Workshop being the first one developed](http://discourse.opentechschool.org/t/building-an-html-css-workshop/21) and hosted collaboratively by teams of multiple chapters simultaneously and with a few joining the half-yearly strategic review meeting in November. Another topic is to make the work and processes more transparent and easier to join. This also applies to the Foundation, which hasn't been very visible nor transparent this year.

P.S. Of course there has been more: [We've created plenty more slides](http://opentechschool.github.io/slides/), went to and spoke [at](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/05/join-us-at-codemotion.html) [various](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/05/presenting-at-codemotion-the-state-of-tech-education.html) [conferences](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/10/kiwi-pycon.html), were featured in [Year of Open Source](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/10/kiwi-pycon.html), started a knowledge base (didn't go so well) and an online forum (doing much better), [supported awesome initiatives](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/07/naitobi-dev-school.html) and [got great support](http://blog.opentechschool.org/2013/08/paypal-donations.html) ourselves.
